## Application Description

A ice cream logger app with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM that lets users input the names of ice cream flavors they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a ice cream flavor, the app will display the ice cream flavor on the page.
Each ice cream flavor in the waiting area also has a Devour button. When the user clicks Devour, the ice cream will move to the right side of the page. This app stores every ice cream in a database, whether devoured or not.
